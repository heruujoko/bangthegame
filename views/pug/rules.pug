    h1 How to Play
    p The game hosted on this website is based on the board game &copy;BANG! The Dice Game. The same rules with the board game version are adapted and followed. For an overview of the rules click on the link 
     a(href='https://www.ultraboardgames.com/bang/dice-game-rules.php').text here.
    
    h2 Create / Join Game
    p The player has an option to either create or join a game. On a game creation, a random 4-digit ID is generated corresponding to the room. If you create a new game, you can restrict access to people that you share the Game ID with by leaving the following option unticked: 
        img.img-fluid(src='/public/images/allow_tick.png') 
        span  . If this option is ticked, other players without the Game ID are allowed to join your game.
    
    p To join a game, you can either join a random open game or enter a Game ID that has been shared with you and join the Game with that ID.

    h2 Lobby
    p Once you entered a lobby, you may indicate that you are ready to start by clicking on Ready button. A <b>minimum of 4 players</b> is required to start a game. Once this minimum number is reached, and all players are ready, the game creator can start the game.
